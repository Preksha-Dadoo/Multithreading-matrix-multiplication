# Multithreading-matrix-multiplication
## Description
Multithreading is a programming concept that allows concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single process. Threads are lightweight sub-processes that share the same memory space but execute independently, enabling efficient multitasking and better utilization of system resources.

## Inputs 
1.Six different number ranges:

[10, 20]
[-10, 10]
[-100, 0]

2.Refresh intervals:

10 seconds <br />
20 seconds <br />
8 seconds <br />
12 seconds <br />
16 seconds <br />
